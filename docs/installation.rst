Installation
============

.. note::
  The following instructions assume you already have a working version of ``pip`` and ``git`` installed in your machine. If this is not the case, please refer to `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ and `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ installation instructions

Using ``git``
=============

At the moment ```hunchat`` is not available as a ``pip`` package. So the only way to install it is by cloning the code repository::

  git clone https://github.com/hunchat/hunchat-api.git

Dependencies
============

To install the dependencies, we recommend that you create a virtual environment and proceed to install the requirements from the ``requirements.txt`` file with ``pip``::

  pip install -r requirements.txt
